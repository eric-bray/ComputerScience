<p><b>Description: </b>This course introduces the student to the discipline of Computer Science. While learning to program in the Python language, students will be exposed to core computer science concepts.

<p><b>Student Learning Objectives:</b>Upon completing this course students will be able to:<ul>
  <li> Describe the goals of the discipline of computer science,
  <li> Design and implement simple programs to solve a variety of problems
  <li> Explain and use the elementary program concepts of assignment statements, loop statements, and decision statements
  <li> Use functional abstraction to enhance program readability and reusability
  <li> Construct and use simple classes to further abstract concepts
  <li> Effectively and appropriately use string and list data structures in their program solutions 
  <li> Work in small teams to implement solutions to larger problems</ul>

        
<p><b>Attendance:</b> Attendance will be taken daily. Students with excessive absences may be required to do extra work to demonstrate their mastery of any missed topics. Further, excessive absences will relieve the instructor of any obligation to "catch up" a student through private tutoring.
                
<p><b>Grading:</b> Students will complete 4 tests, approximately 20 programming laboratories/projects, homework exercises from the end of each chapter, and a final project. Unless expressly stated, all homework and projects are due the next class day. The 10% per day late penalty will be strictly enforced. These items will be weighted as follows:
                
<blockquote>       
  <table width="60%" border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="0">
  <tbody><tr align="center">
            <td width="75%">Four Tests</td><td width="25%">   70%  </td>
            </tr><tr align="center">
            <td>Programs, Labs, and Homework</td><td>  30% </td>
            </tr>                                     
    </tbody>                          
  </table>
</blockquote>
                
<p>Class curve will be no stricter than:
<blockquote>
<table width="60%" border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="0">
<tbody>
<tr align="center">
        <td> 93.3% </td> <td> A</td> <td> 83.3%</td> <td>  B</td>
        <td> 73.3%</td> <td>  C</td> <td> 63.3%</td> <td>   D</td></tr>
<tr align="center">
        <td> 90.0% </td> <td> A-</td> <td> 80.0%</td> <td>  B-</td>
        <td> 70.0%</td> <td>  C- </td> <td> 60.0%</td> <td>  D- </td></tr>
<tr align="center">
        <td> 86.6% </td> <td> B+</td> <td> 76.6%</td> <td>  C+</td>
        <td> 66.6%</td> <td>  D+</td> <td>&lt; 60%</td> <td> F </td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</blockquote>
                
<p><b>EDIT Honor Code</b>: <i>By attending Wartburg College, students are demonstrating their dedication to the Honor Code. The Honor Code reminds students of their responsibility to promote academic honesty by opposing cheating and plagiarism and reporting dishonest work. </i>(please review your copy of the honor code pamphlet)
                
<p>I take the issue of integrity very seriously. I believe that it is the duty of every to student to do their part to maintain the proper level of honesty in the class. A student who knows of dishonesty in the class and  does nothing about it is cheating him/her self as well as every other student in the class. Instances of cheating will result in a zero for all evaluations of a similar type to date and very close scrutiny of all subsequent   work.   (i.e., if you are dishonest on program 3 you get a 0 for it and retroactive 0's for programs 1 and 2 as well as a very careful reading of all the remaining programs.) A second instance will result in an F for the course.
