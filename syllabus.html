    <p><b>Description: </b>This course introduces the student to the discipline of Computer Science. While learning to program in the Python language, students will be exposed to core computer science concepts.
    
    <p><b>Student Learning Objectives:</b>Upon completing this course students will be able to:<ul>
    <li> Describe the goals of the discipline of computer science,
    <li> Design and implement simple programs to solve a variety of problems
    <li> Explain and use the elementary program concepts of assignment statements, loop statements, and decision statements
    <li> Use functional abstraction to enhance program readability and reusability
    <li> Construct and use simple classes to further abstract concepts
    <li> Effectively and appropriately use string and list data structures in their program solutions 
    <li> Work in small teams to implement solutions to larger problems</ul>
    
    <p><b>Attendance:</b> Attendance will be taken daily. Students with excessive absences may be required to do extra work to demonstrate their mastery of any missed topics. Further, excessive absences will relieve the instructor of any obligation to "catch up" a student through private tutoring.

    <p><b>Academic Honesty</b>: 
    <p>I take the issue of integrity very seriously. I believe that it is the duty of every to student to do their part to maintain the proper level of honesty in the class. A student who knows of dishonesty in the class and does nothing about it is cheating himself as well as every other student in the class. Instances of cheating will be handled according to the school's policies and will also result in very close scrutiny for all subsequent work.
    <p>With respect to coding exercises, you may perceive some "grey areas" where cheating may seem unclear.  Indeed, many programs and lines of code are freely posted on many websites. A good resource to look at for navigating these "grey areas" is from Harvard University's Introduction to Computer Science (CS 50), specifically its <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/syllabus/#academic-honesty">policy on Academic Honesty</a>.
